Description: The ISBaR package implements semiparametric additive Gaussian models 
    equipped with increasing shrinkage priors. Specifically, the multiplicative 
    gamma prior (MGP) and the cumulative shrinkage prior (CUSP) are considered 
    to introuce stochastic increasing regularization effects on the basis
    coefficients. Currently, P-spline, wavelet and Fourier basis expansion are 
    employeed for the estimation of the non-linear components in the model.
